## Note: Multiple ORM Support (Demonstration Only)

This project demonstrates the ease of switching between different Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) using a template structure. Five popular ORM repositories are included, each configured with a separate ORM.

**Important Note:**

- In a real project, you should only use the relevant ORM and its associated files.
- Remove the unused repository and its dependencies (packages) to avoid unnecessary clutter and potential conflicts.

This approach allows you to explore different ORMs during development and easily switch to the chosen one for production deployment.

## Decoupling Business Logic from Database Layer

This project utilizes a layered architecture that separates your business logic from the database layer. This separation offers several benefits:

- **Maintainability:** Changes to the database schema or ORM implementation won't directly impact your business logic, making updates easier and less error-prone.
- **Testability:** You can write unit tests for your business logic without requiring a real database connection, simplifying testing and ensuring code quality.
- **Flexibility:** You can switch between different database technologies or ORMs in the future without significant code changes, making your application more adaptable.

By decoupling these layers, you create a more robust, maintainable, and flexible software architecture.
